Step 1: Cluster set-up
We are setting-up K8s cluster (one master and one node) using kubeadm (K8s-v1.16). 

# bash cluster-setup.sh
Note: Run script as "root" user

Step 2: Deploy Nginx Ingress controller

Step 3: Deploy Juiceshop application and expose via Ingress

Step 4: Enable modsecurity for Ingress to prevent SQLinjection

Ref: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/#lua-resty-waf

Note: cluster-setup.sh script will perform all the above mentioned steps.

To allow certain CIDR range have an access to kube-apiserver can de done via either using NACL (subnet level) or via SecurityGroups (instance level). We need to whitelist those IP's for kube-apiserver (port: 6443) to have an inbound connection only from those IP's.
